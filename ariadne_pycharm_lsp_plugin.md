# Building the Plugin for PyCharm

This plugin modification fixes some crashes and also changes the use of the control key so that it is modal.  In this plugin, pressing ctrl toggles hover messages between those from Ariadne and others.

## Steps

* ```git clone https://github.com/juliandolby/intellij-lsp```

* Import project into [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

* Click on the `plugin.xml` file

* Select option `Prepare Plugin Module 'LSP' For Deployment`

* Install LSP.zip into PyCharm as a plugin
