## What is it?
WALA Ariadne uses static analayis of python for TensorFlow to give machine learning practitioners the modern software development support.

## How does it work?
Through static analysis techniques (provided by WALA) such as Data Flow analysis, WALA Ariadne is able to provide type-like functionality that tracks tensors, provides backward slicing to track variables, and much more. We make this functionality available through the Language Server Protocol, meaning in most cases, it's as easy as a simple configuration to get any LSP-supported enviroment up and running.

## What IDEs / Editors are supported?
Right now, we support almost every environment and editor that utilizes LSP.
Atom, VSCode, PyCharm, Sublime, Emacs, Vim and NeoVim are known to work.
JupyterLabs does not yet support LSP, but work is in progress.
Spyder and Eclipse are coming soon.

## How can I help?
We are currently looking for real life code examples to analyze. Leave it messy, leave it commented, we prefer to see the code in its natural state. Let us know what made it annoying or difficult to write, the bugs your encountered, and what kinds of support you'd like to see from a *static* analysis tool.
