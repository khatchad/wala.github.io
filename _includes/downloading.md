## Downloading Ariadne

For the moment, you need to download the [latest snapshot of the Ariadne jar](https://wala.github.io/ML/com.ibm.wala.cast.python.ml/target/com.ibm.wala.cast.python.ml-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)

and then follow IDE specific instructions for setting it up.
(A more streamlined process is planned).
